Typically two speakers participate in a conversation. Your job is to chat about a movie ${movie_name_1} while playing the role of both Speaker1 and Speaker2. You need to follow these rules:

1) While acting as Speaker2 you are allowed to only pick sentences (as it is) from one of the resources provided: Plot (P), Review (R), Comments (C).</br>
2) While acting as Speaker2 you are allowed to insert some words at the beginning of the picked sentence to make the conversation coherent.</br>
2) While acting as Speaker1 you need to create your own sentences such that it connects well to the sentence you inserted while acting as Speaker 1. Hence, the marking for Speaker1 shall always be None i,e (N) </br>
3) Also while acting as Speaker1 you should create your sentences in such a way that there is clear scope for Speaker 2 (which is again you) to continue the conversation using one of the resources</br>
4) We have provided the first utterance coming from both Speaker1 and Speaker2. You need to continue from there</br>
5) The chat should be coherent </br>
6) The chat SHOULD NOT BE just a collection of alternate question answer pairs </br>
7) You need to use as many resources as possible. Try using all of them but ensuring that there is a proper flow of context in the conversation.</br></p>

<p> Please look at the Tips and Tricks section </p>

<p><strong>Submission format for one exchange </strong></p>

<p> Speaker1 (N) : Sentence </p>
<p> Speaker2 (Resource) : Sentence </p>

<p>Use &#39;P&#39; for Plot, &#39;C&#39; for Comment, &#39;R&#39; for Resource &#39;F&#39; for Fact Table </p>

<p> <strong> Tips and Tricks </strong> </p>
</p>Here are some important tips and tricks that can help you complete the HIT faster than the expected time. <p>
<p> 1. Decide on what aspect of the movie that you want to talk about say music, actor, director, cinematography and so on before you read the whole review/plot/comment and pick relevant sentences for the conversation. This will lead to faster HIT completetion</p>
<p> 2. Don't waste your time in reading the whole review/plot in detail. You can skim read to get an idea of the movie. </p>
<p> 3. Typically, plots can be used for scene description or talking about the story of the movie </p>
<p> 4. The reviews are opinions of people and can be used to discuss more about the chosen apect </p>
<p> 5. The comments are one-liners capturing . Suitable for replies when you can't think of one or when you want to change an aspect of a movie </p>
<p> 6. The HIT performance time will improve as you do more number of HITs. Don't give up if a single HIT was time consuming </p>

<p>For example, consider the conversation on <strong>Dunkirk </strong></p> 

<p><strong>Plot </strong>:</p>

<p>The British navy requisitions civilian vessels that can get close to the beach. In Weymouth, Mr. Dawson and his son Peter set out on his boat <span  style = "color : red">Moonstone </span> rather than let the navy take it. Impulsively, their teenage friend George joins them. At sea, they rescue a shell-shocked officer from a wrecked ship. When he realises that Dawson is sailing for Dunkirk, the officer demands that they turn back, and tries to wrest control of the boat; in the struggle, George suffers a head injury that renders him blind. </p>

<p><strong>Review </strong>:</p>

<p>​ 
Dunkirk is edge of your seat filmmaking. Can honestly say I've never seen anything like it.A lot of people were wondering about Harry_styles & unknown cast. They're all great but Dunkirk is not about any one solider. Also 'Dunkirk' is another brilliant collaboration between Nolan & HansZimmer. <span style="color:red">The way he mixes in a ticking clock with score is nail biting.</span>DUNKIRK relies on very little dialogue.We all know what happened on that beach, but Nolan's take is worth visiting. Yes, DUNKIRK relies heavily on sound of an increasingly fast ticking clock to build suspense.Drop everything and go watch Dunkirk. <span style="color:red">It is an experience. Not a mere film. </span>​ ​</p>

<p><strong>Comment </strong>:</p>

<p>This is a very important movie, because <span style="color:red">it doesn&#39;t glamorize or glorify war.​ </span><br />
​Just awesome! Simply awesome!​<br />
​Hans Zimmer did really great with the score and it really was an immersive experience</p>

<h5><strong>Conversation</strong></h5>
Speaker1 (N) : What do you think about the movie ? </br> 
Speaker2 (C) : I think the movie was brilliant. </br>
Speaker1 (N) : Agreed! One of the finest in this genre. <span style="color: green">(A casual sentence to start expressing your thoughts about the same.) </span></br>
Speaker2 (C) : <i>I believe</i> the best part about the movie is that it doesn't glamorize or glorify war. <span style="color: green">(picked from a review - the words I believe are inserted at the beginning to make the conversation coherent)</span></br>
Speaker1 (N) : Totally! Oh by the way do you remember the name of the ship headed by Mr.Dawson ? <span style="color: green">(Speaker1 listens and appreciates Speaker2's thoughts and continues discussing with a new aspect, in this case small details about the movie. Speaker 1 deliberately creates a question which can be answered from the plot)</span></br>
Speaker2 (P) : Yes. It was Moonstone <span style="color: green">(This can be inferred only if you read the plot)</span></br>
Speaker1 (N) : Right. I am always impressed by the Nolan - Hans Zimmer collaboration. <span style="color: green">(Speaker1 gets the answer, but there's no need of elaborating on Moonstone further. Hence Speaker1 talks about the people behind the movie - once again paving way for the next utterance to be picked up from the given resources) </span></br>
Speaker2 (R) : The way he mixes in a ticking clock with score is nail biting. <span style="color: green">(Speaker2 continues appreciating Hans Zimmer.)</span></br>
Speaker1 (N) : Some of the scenes seem so real, I feel I was present right there at that very moment. <span style="color: green">(Speaker1 creates a sentence which connects well to the previous utterance) </span></br>
Speaker2 (R) : To sum it up, it is an experience. Not a mere film <span style="color: green"> (Speaker 2 intelligently picks a sentence from the resources and gives a closure to the entire conversation. you need not always give a closure to the conversation but choose a sentence such that it makes the overall conversation look coherent)</span></br>
Speaker1 (N) : That's an interesting way to put it. Can you recommend any other movies ?</br>
Speaker2 (F) : You should check out Saving Private Ryan</br>


<hr />
<p>As you can see in the above example:<br />
The <span style="color:red">red</span> are the sentences picked from resources to continue the conversation.<br />
The resource initial(C,N,P,R) is mentioned at the start of the sentence followed by colon (:) and then the sentence<br />
The words in <i> italics </i> are added to retain the coherence of the conversation
The explanation is given in  <span style="color:green">green</span></p>

<p>One sentence corresponds to one speaker. You are encouraged to make the chats as coherent as possible and as creative in terms of conversation as possible.</p>

<p>Give 8 sentences. Alternate exchanges correspond to one speaker. You will be writing 4 sentences for the speaker 'Speaker1' and 4 sentences for the speaker 'Speaker2'</p>

<p>Try to keep the conversation only to movies and do not digress. Talk about directors, actors, plots, actresses, scenes, genres, performances, awards, trivia, etc, related to the movie.</p>
